The P controller used for best result is 20, and the I controller is 1. The integration error is defined as the accumualted error twist (Xerr) so far during the process of generating end-effector twist along the trajectory. The initial configuration of the cube is (0m, -1m, pi/2rad) and the goal configuration is (0m, 1m, pi/2rad). Since the controllers are the same as the best result, the result converges very fast.
